    summary: |
      I am a doctoral student in [DSLAB](dslab.epfl.ch) and [NAL](nal.epfl.ch)
      at [EPFL](epfl.ch). I lead the [Vigor](vigor.github.com) project, that makes it
      possible to apply formal verification to real application for common software
      developers.

      I am interested most in programming languages, computer systems and formal methods.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Applied Physics and Mathematics
      university: Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
      time: 2012 - 2014
      details: |
        I specialized in software engineering and PL systems at the
        Department of Radioelectronics and Cybernetics.
        During the studies I read lectures and lead practical groups in compiler construction
        for juniour students.
        Honors degree, top 1% of the class.

    - degree: BSc in Applied Physics and Mathematics
      university: Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
      time: 2008 - 2012

      details: |
        I lead the [Vigor](vignat.github.io) project that enables regular developers
        of software network functions to apply formal verification
        to their applications.
        A core team of 6 people (doctoral students, professors and a postdoc)
        contributes to the project on a permanent basis, and more than
        10 MS and BS students join for semester or summer internship.

        As part of the job, I coach student teams (4-7 people per team) as
        they learn applying scrum metodology in their semester project - android
        application development.
        My advisors:

         - Prof. [Katerina Argyraki](people.epfl.ch/katerina.argyraki)
         - Prof. [George Candea](dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/)
